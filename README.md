Dimensionality reduction is a essential technique in the data science, especially when working
with the datasets which contains a large number of features. As the number of features in the
dataset increases, it will become challenging to process, interpret, visualize the data and increases
the computational costs. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a powerful method for addressing
these issues by identifying the most important patterns in the data, PCA reduces the number of
features while retaining the majority of the information. In this project, we have utilized the PCA
to simplify the Wine dataset, which contains chemical properties of wines. Our objective is to
improve visualization and the computational efficiency while maintaining the high classification
performance. This project demonstrates the steps involved in applying PCA, evaluating its impact
on machine learning models, and explores how it can enhance the data interpretation.
